# Simple Emacs Configuration

This is a simple configuration setup for Emacs. It should work by just cloning the repository into `~/.config/emacs/`

If you run into errors downloading the packages, try `M-x package-refresh-contents RET` and `package-install RET *package throwing the error*`

## Main Uses

This configuration is primarily used for two things:

### Lisp/Scheme Programming

This is my primary use case. I've tried VS Code and Neovim for this but nothing beats Emacs when it comes to the
Lisp/Scheme developer experience.

### Documentation

This is the other reason why I use Emacs. I've also not found anything that comes close to the experience of creating and editing
documentation and notes like you can in Emacs. Org-mode alone makes it worth it to use emacs.

## Requirements

As far as software goes, this config is pretty self contained. There are some things that would be handy to install like `ripgrep`
or `hunspell` but they aren't required for you to be able to use the configuration as is.

You will need to know your way around modal editing with Vim to get the most out of it.
